# WebScraper
Website Scraper tool
# Python script that uses the requests and beautifulsoup4 libraries to scrape a website:
To run this script on Kali Linux, you need to have the requests and beautifulsoup4 libraries installed. You can install them using the following commands:


pip install requests



pip install beautifulsoup4


# Save the script to a file, such as website_scraper.py, and then run the script using the following command:


python3 WebScraper.py


Replace http://example.com with the URL of the website you want to scrape. The script uses requests to retrieve the HTML content of the website and BeautifulSoup to parse and extract information from the HTML.

Please note that when scraping websites, you should ensure that you have proper authorization and comply with the website's terms of service. Respect the website's robots.txt file and be mindful of any restrictions or guidelines set by the website owner.
